[Program #1: Reverse Printing (printRev)]

	$ ./prev <input_string>

	Argument:	<input_string>	String to be reversed
	Functionality:	Prints the reversed <input_string>. 
	Algorithm:	1. Recursively call "print_reverse,"
			2. print the last character per call, 
			3. and accumulate string length per call.

	Testing result:
			Printed string length overflows when actual string length is 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, or >=16. 
			An overflowing number, 32767, appears at the last recursive call and before recursion returning. 
	Bug mechanism:
			Faulty return value at the start of recursion returning (zero-length string). 
	Bug amendment:
			(pr_buggy.c:41)		return rest;	-->	return 0;

[Program #2: Prime Number (primeNumber)]

	$ ./primeNumber

	Argument:	None
	Functionality:	Prints all prime numbers smaller than 1000. 
	Algorithm:	1. Iterate over candidates in [2, 1000); 
			2. For a candidate NUM, iterate over divisors in [2, sqrt(N));
			3. If a divisor D divides NUM evenly, assert that NUM is not prime and quit iteration;
			4. Assert that NUM is prime if all divisors are iterated.

		[BUG]	25 is prime.										// 25 included in 2 steps
														// should be excluded in 3 steps

	Testing result:
			The list of prime numbers also include the square of actual prime numbers, 
			which SHOULD HAVE BEEN excluded if the test is done for another step. 
	(Possible) bug mechanism:
			Check range in "is_prime" adjusted from [2, num-1] to [2, sqrt(num)), 
			which neglects the case in which divides_evenly(sqrt(num), num) == 1. 
	(Possible) bug amendment:
			Alter the check range to [2, sqrt(num)].

[Program #3: Heap Sorting (sort)]

	$ ./sort <input_file>

	Argument:	<input_file>	File in the following format:
						N
						arr[0] arr[1] ... arr[N-1]
					Here, "arr" contains the numbers to be sorted. 
					N refers to the length of "arr". 
	Functionality:	Prints the sorted "arr". 
	Algorithm:	1. Initialize heap: 	construct the numbers into a tree; 
			2. Maximize heap: 	starting from the bottom of the tree, scanning from right to left, 
						swap a pair of parent-child nodes if the child is larger than the parent; 
			3. Perform sorting:	swap the root node and the "last" node (indicated by a pointer, 
						starting from the bottom right), decrement the pointer, and return to Step 2.

	Tracing history:
			(Omitted due to oversized input and unstable behavior)
	
	Testing result:
			Output is unstable; that is, repeatedly calling the function yields varying results. 
	(Possible) bug mechanism:
			Though strange at first sight, it is highly probable that MEMORY ISSUES are involved. 
			Either there lacks a "free()" command freeing array space before the program terminates, 
			or the input size of 50 integers causes the array to overflow "into itself" and produce self-overwriting behaviors. 
			This bug only arises in cases with sufficiently many integers to be sorted, among which are sufficiently many ZEROS.
