    ###### Functionality ######
    Compile by running:
        gcc -g -Wall main.c mp4.c -o stamps
    Execute by running:
        ./stamps <amount> <s1> <s2> <s3> <s4>
    The program outputs:
        <s1_best> <s2_best> <s3_best> <s4_best>
    which constitutes the best scheme of stamps. 
    The best scheme is determined as follows:
        (1) Total value of stamps in scheme is no less than <amount>; 
        (2) If ties occur in (1), select the scheme whose total value exceeds <amount> the least; 
        (3) If ties occur in (2), select the scheme with the least total number of stamps; 
        (4) If ties occur in (3), select the scheme with the largest <s1_best>; 
        (5) If ties occur in (4), select the scheme with the largest <s2_best>; 
        (6) If ties occur in (5), select the scheme with the largest <s3_best>.
